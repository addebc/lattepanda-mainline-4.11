The Kernel version 4.11.0-rc8 was based on Ubuntu mainline build to have a better experience.
git://git.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-kernel-test/ubuntu/+source/linux/+git/mainline-crack

Unlike UP board, this kernel should work for other CherryTrail tablets and laptops, because LattePanda focused on the Atmel MCU and developed it.

This repository could be cooperative. Any comments and suggestions will be appreciated.

Testing OS on LattePanda(4G/64G):
Ubuntu 16.04.2 64Bit LTS 
GCC version 5.4.0 20160609

Patch:
WiFi (rtl8723bs directory and in Tree)
Bluetooth (rtl8723bs_bt directory)
Audio (ucm directory)
PWM (in Tree)

BIOS:
South Bridge -> Chipset -> SCC Configuration
SCC SDIO Support -> PCI Mode
SCC SD Card Support -> PCI Mode

Steps:
1. Install Ubuntu 16.04.2 ISO from Ubuntu official website, make sure that installation is only in UEFI boot mode.
2. modify GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash intel_idle.max_cstate=1" to /etc/default/grub, it will prevent system freeze.
3. In the terminal, sudo apt-get update
4. sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
5. sudo apt-get install git
6. git clone this repository.
7. cd in
8. make mrproper
9. make upboard_defconfig
10. make -j4
11. sudo make modules_install
12. sudo make firmware_install
13. sudo make headers_install
14. sudo make install
15. patch UCM configuration file to /usr/share/alsa/ucm/chtrt5645
16. build rtl8723bs_bt dirver
17. move binary to /usr/sbin
18. add systemd service rtl8723bsbt.service
19. link BT service for all users
20. patch BT and WiFi firmware to /lib/firmware

p.s. 
If you see warnings as follows:
W: Possible missing firmware /lib/firmware/i915/kbl_dmc_ver1_01.bin for module i915
W: Possible missing firmware /lib/firmware/i915/kbl_guc_ver9_14.bin for module i915
W: Possible missing firmware /lib/firmware/i915/bxt_guc_ver8_7.bin for module i915

Download and install firmwares, but assume that CherryTrail is not involved in the firmwares.

21. reboot and play, you could edit your grub menu to roll back original kernel.

Package: (split Zip file)
Prebuilt Linux kernel and modules by a DEB file, it is easy to install.
